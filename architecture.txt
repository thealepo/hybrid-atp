WORKFLOW:
    - Natural Language Theorem
    - [reasoner_model]
    - Proof Strategy Decision + Subgoal
    - [Search Algorithm (FCM + LLM)]
    - Generate candidate tactics
    - [Lean Validation]
        - Success: continue to next Subgoal
        - Failure: backtrack search & update FCM
    - Repeat
    - VALID PROOF
